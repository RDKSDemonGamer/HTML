    <p3 style="font-size:30px">The Fortnite World Cup is an annual esports competition based on the video game Fortnite, with the inaugural final events taking place July 26–28, 2019 at the 
        Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York City, United States. A total US$30 million prize pool was available across the various competitions.</p3>
      <p>
        <p4 style="font-size:30px">The Fortnite World Cup uses two of the game modes available to the video game, Fortnite. The main World Cup event as well as the Pro-Am use 
          Fortnite Battle Royale, a battle royale game where up to 100 players airdrop onto an island without any weapons or armor, save for a pickaxe. Once on the 
          ground, players must scavenge for weapons, armor, and healing items, as well as using their pickaxe to knock down existing features to gather wood, stone, and 
          metal resources. This all must be done while avoiding attacks from other players, as well as staying within a shrinking circle on the map or risk taking fatal damage 
          outside it. Players can use gathered resources to build walls, floors, and stairs and ramps to use as cover from attacks. The last player or team left alive wins. 
          In Fortnite Creative, players can build unique courses at their own pace, which can be used to create competitive events that can then share with others.</p4>
        </p>
        <p>
          <p5 style="font-size:30px">
            The Fortnite World Cup had online events over 10 weeks from April to June 2019 for people to place. The weeks alternated between solo players and duos teams. During 
            the Saturday of each week, any player or duo could compete with others by geographic region, playing up to 10 matches to earn points through eliminations and victories. 
            The top three thousand players/teams from each region then competed on the Sunday event, again playing up to ten matches to earn points. The top point-scorers in each region 
            from the Sunday event then proceed through to the World Cup, a total of about twenty players/teams each week.[1] An estimated 40 million players vied for spots in the solo and 
            duos World Cup.[2] In the World Cup finals, the competitors played a total of six matches, with points earned for the highest finishers. The solo player or duo with the highest
             point total after six matches won the grand prize, with other players getting part of the prize pool available.[3] All solo players received a minimum of US$50,000 for reaching
              the finals, with the top prize being US$3 million. Similarly, each duo team in the final received a minimum of US$100,000 with the top team winning US$3 million.[4]</p5>
          </p>
          <p>
            <p6 style="font-size:30px">
              The Fortnite Creative Cup had a similar online process to select the players for the finals, taking place over five two-week periods from April to June 2019. Each active week,
               a new Creative challenge is available. Players, once completed with their Creative island, must submit a video of that challenge to Epic in that period. For each period, Epic 
               selected three of the best entries by a panel of judges. Each selected entry earns a cash prize of US$5,000 and a guaranteed spot in the Creative Cup finals. From the fifteen 
               winning entries, five were selected by Epic to be used in the Creative Cup finales.[5] In the finales, eight teams of four, consisting of those that had their Creative island 
               selected and other notable Fortnite players, complete in these five events to earn the best overall score. The winners in the finale split a US$3 million prize pool.[1] </p6>
          </p>
          <p>
            <p7 style="font-size:30px">The teams for the Fortnite Pro-Am are selected by Epic Games, with each team made up of a Fortnite streamer and a celebrity. The teams each played five matches, with a scoring 
              system for the winning teams. The team with the highest overall score after five matches won the Pro-Am. Each team received a minimum of US$20,000 with the winning team receiving
               US$2 million</p7>

            Morbius is a 2022 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, produced by Columbia Pictures in association with Marvel. Distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing, it is the third film in Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU). Directed by Daniel Espinosa and written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, it stars Jared Leto as Dr. Michael Morbius, alongside Matt Smith, Adria Arjona, Jared Harris, Al Madrigal, and Tyrese Gibson. In the film, Morbius and his surrogate brother Milo become living vampires after curing themselves of a rare blood disease.
            There were several attempts to bring Morbius to the big screen since 1998, including joining the Blade franchise and having a solo film produced by Artisan Entertainment, neither of which ever came to fruition. After announcing plans for a new shared universe of films inspired by Spider-Man related characters beginning with Venom (2018), Sony began developing a film based on Morbius. Sazama and Sharpless had written a script by November 2017, and Leto and Espinosa officially joined in June 2018. Work on the film began at the end of the year with further casting, ahead of production starting in London in February 2019. Filming was confirmed to have been completed by June 2019, with reshoots happening in Los Angeles the following February.
            Morbius premiered at the Plaza Carso in Mexico City on March 10, 2022, and was theatrically released in the United States on April 1, 2022, after being delayed several times from an initial July 2020 date primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It received largely negative reviews from critics, with criticism towards its writing, visual effects, and post-credits scenes, though Smith's performance received some praise and became the subject of various internet memes. Though it performed reasonably well on its opening weekend, the film underperformed overall at box office and only grossed over $163 million worldwide against a $75–83 million budget.

            <p9 style="font-size:30px">
              <h2 style="font-size:30px">Introduction </h2>
             <p1 style="font-size:30px">I.G.I.-2: Covert Strike, known in the PAL region as Project I.G.I. 2, is a 2003 tactical shooter video game developed by Innerloop Studios and released by Codemasters. The game is a stealth-based first-person shooter. It is the sequel to Innerloop's Project I.G.I.. The original, published by Eidos Interactive, offered only single-player play, and no game saves. Covert Strike added multiplayer play and limited save game capability. Chris Ryan, a former Special Air Service operative best known for being the lone successful escapee of Bravo Two Zero, served as a consultant to the game.
              The game's plot features a rogue Chinese General, "Wu Xing" as the primary antagonist. Xing orchestrates various events (such as armed robbery of advanced prototype technology from the Russian mafia) in order to get electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weaponry on a space rocket that he has launch control over.
              The game was banned in China after six months of sales (having passed censor inspection with an incomplete copy of the game that lacked the final six levels of Chinese content), because it was perceived to damage the Chinese army's image.</p1> 
              <p>
               <h3 style="font-size:30px">Plot</h3>
               <p2 style="font-size:30px">The game's protagonist, David Jones,[2] an agent working for the Institute for Geotactical Intelligence and former British SAS operator,[3] was sent to the Carpathian mountains to recover a set of prototype EMP chips stolen by a group of Russian mafia from a high-tech US facility. After HALO jumping and infiltrating a weather station, Jones retrieves a chip that was stolen. The researchers at IGI conclude after close examination that the chip that Jones found was actually an improved version of the chip. Then his mission director (Phillip White having replaced an injured Rebecca Anya) commands him to go to retrieve the remaining EMP chips so that the IGI researchers can launch a full scale research on the chips to determine their real usage for which the Russian mafia stole them for. He is then transported to a local Russian storage facility where a convoy carrying the chips is due to arrive. He is instructed to obtain C4 explosives from the facility and destroy the bridge on which the convoy would pass and retrieve the chips by intercepting the convoy. After successful completion of his objective, he is then transported to a Russian weapons production facility to get the remaining EMP chips and their blue prints on White's orders. After this incident, he is betrayed by his pilot, Robert Quest and mission director, Phillip White as they take the EMP chips obtained by Jones. Jones is forced to jump from the helicopter in which he was being carried by Quest and he eventually finds himself at the borders of Ukraine and Romania, where he is forced to evade the incoming border patrols while being ill-equipped.
               Meanwhile, his former pilot and mission director had escaped and have taken away the EMP chips along with their blue prints. The IGI was not able to detect their whereabouts after the incident, but spent enough efforts to get an important detail that Phillip White and Robert Quest took years to infiltrate the IGI and gain its trust and that White had made several weapons and military deals with Jach Priboi in Libya. Anya returns as Jones' mission director and Jones sets off to Libya under the orders of Senator Lenahan to search for the middle-aged Priboi, who had been locked up by the Libyan Intelligence as he was supplying weapons to the rebel forces, after David finds Priboi, he is captured by the Libyan intelligence commander Major Zaleb Said. The two are then transported to a heavily guarded Libyan prison. While they are being transported, Priboi asks him about his purpose of finding him, Jones responds by saying that he is after his former mission director Phillip White and that the IGI knows that White made weapon deals with him. Priboi then reveals that he made a lot of deals with White and sold him advanced equipment. His last order from Priboi was a high tech Russian ekranoplan which was waiting for delivery on a remote sea port in the gulf. The shipping papers were in a safe in Priboi's villa which was currently taken over by Major Zaleb Said and being used as his base of operations.
               After rescuing Priboi and escaping out of the prison, David decides to go to the villa to get the information. While going there, David blows the truck's engine in which they escaped. Priboi then told him that he needs to infiltrate the villa by disabling the security system and bypassing Major Said's guards. He also needs to take his hard disk which contains all the data for Priboi's transactions with White. Surprisingly, after expunging much effort and going through many of gunfights, Priboi discovers that Major Said had taken away his papers from the villa and he then vows angrily to take them back. He tells David to take control of his helicopter which is in his airbase not far away from the villa now controlled by Major Said. They get the helicopter without much conflict, and manage to gun Major Said down at one of his bases amidst the opposition to get the papers back. Upon returning to his villa, Priboi tells David that the trade he made with David's former mission director was on Port Bur Safaga in Egypt and that Robert Quest would be taking delivery of the plane in 3 days.
               David sets off to the port without hesitation, where he is instructed by Anya to find the Enkranoplan and a crate of stolen EMP chips. While searching the log books to find the Enkranoplan, David discovers that Robert Quest and Phillip White were actually cooperating with an unknown country to operate the chips. He is confronted by his former pilot in the process who orders his men to throw David in the water with the sewage. David ambushes Quest's men and kills him after a confrontation. He then takes the ekranoplan to venture off to unknown country which is later revealed to be the Spratly Islands near China,[4] where, according to Anya, suspicious activities are carried out throughout the time being. After a series of events, David finds his former mission director cooperating in secrecy with a Chinese general, whom he found out later to be General Wu Xing, who plans to use the chips to blindfold US intelligence and cripple the powers within.
               Later David finds his former mission director Phillip White killed by General Wu Xing himself, as the former accused the latter of killing his friend Robert Quest, who was actually killed by David at the Egyptian port. In Wu Xing's secret weapons lab, David Jones gets to know that the General was going to start a "World War III". He then engages in a gunfight with Wu Xing and kills him.
               David tracks the entire plan location to a large and closely guarded rocket launch pad, where Anya asks him to disable the system immediately before the launch is made. With efforts, David then succeeds in preventing the rocket from heading towards its programmed destination and to detonate somewhere safe.</p2>

                <h4 style="font-size:30px">mission</h4>
                <p3 style="font-size:30px">The game is divided into 19 missions. The story is presented in cutscenes, shown before and after every mission, with animated characters rendered in real-time and pre-recorded speech. Missions have objectives that must be completed before the mission ends.
                Straightforward approaches are not encouraged, with stealthy and covert movement giving the player a better rating, rank and chance of survival, with the highest attainable ranking entitled 'David Jones'.
                Multiple paths exist for every mission, with the most obvious and daunting being a noisy gunfight, because in every mission Jones is outnumbered. Every mission presents an opportunity for large groups of enemies to be bypassed or sneaked past, undiscovered. Certain missions even require entire operations to be carried out undetected.
                At the start of a new game, a difficulty level can be chosen, changing the number of bullets Jones takes before dying, the intelligence of the enemy and group AI, and the number of save-games available.</p3>

          <h5 style="font-size:30px" >Introduction</h5>
            <p4 style="font-size:30px">Thor: Love and Thunder is a 2022 American superhero film based on Marvel Comics featuring the character Thor, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to Thor: Ragnarok (2017) and the 29th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film is directed by Taika Waititi, who co-wrote the script with Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, and stars Chris Hemsworth as Thor alongside Christian Bale, Tessa Thompson, Jaimie Alexander, Waititi, Russell Crowe, and Natalie Portman. In the film, Thor attempts to find inner peace, but must return to action and recruit Valkyrie (Thompson), Korg (Waititi), and Jane Foster (Portman)—who is now the Mighty Thor—to stop Gorr the God Butcher (Bale) from eliminating all gods.
            Hemsworth and Waititi had discussed plans for a sequel to Ragnarok by January 2018. Love and Thunder was announced in July 2019, with Hemsworth, Waititi, and Thompson all set to return, as well as Portman who did not appear in Ragnarok. Waititi wanted to differentiate Love and Thunder from Ragnarok, seeking to make a romance film and 1980s-inspired adventure. He adapted elements from Jason Aaron's run on the Mighty Thor comic book, which sees Foster take on the mantle and powers of Thor whilst under treatment for cancer. Robinson joined to contribute to the script in February 2020, and further casting was revealed later that year including the appearance of the Guardians of the Galaxy. Production was expected to begin in late 2020 but was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Filming ultimately began in January 2021 in Sydney, Australia, and concluded at the beginning of June.
            Thor: Love and Thunder premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood on June 23, 2022, and was released in the United States on July 8, as part of Phase Four of the MCU. The film earned praise for its light-hearted nature and the cast's performances, particularly those of Bale and Portman, while criticism was aimed at the screenplay and tonal inconsistency, with several critics deeming the film inferior to its predecessor. Love and Thunder has grossed over $662 million worldwide, becoming the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2022.</p4>

            Jon Favreau, Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Benedict Wong, Tony Revolori, Marisa Tomei, Andrew Garfield, and Tobey Maguire. In the film, Parker asks Dr. Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch) to use magic to make his identity as Spider-Man a secret again following its public revelation at the end of Far From Home. When the spell goes wrong, the multiverse is broken open, which allows visitors from alternate realities to enter Parker's universe.

            <p6 style="font-size:30px">
              A third MCU Spider-Man film was planned during the production of Homecoming in 2017. Negotiations between Sony and Marvel Studios to alter their deal—in which they produce the Spider-Man films together—ended with Marvel Studios leaving the project in August 2019, but a negative fan reaction led to a new deal between the companies a month later. Watts, McKenna, Sommers, and Holland were set to return, and filming took place from October 2020 to March 2021 in New York City and Atlanta. No Way Home features several actors
              reprising their roles from non-MCU Spider-Man films directed by Sam Raimi and Marc Webb, including previous Spider-Man actors Maguire and Garfield. The involvement of both actors was the subject of wide speculation and numerous leaks despite the efforts of Sony, Marvel, and the cast to conceal their involvement.

No Way Home has grossed over $1.9 billion worldwide, surpassing its predecessor as the highest-grossing film released by Sony Pictures.

The film received numerous awards and nominations, including a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 94th Academy Awards. A sequel is in development.

        <p>
        <p9 style="font-size:30px">
          The Last: Naruto the Movie is a 2014 Japanese animated action-romance film produced by Studio Pierrot and directed by Tsuneo Kobayashi. It is based on Masashi Kishimoto's manga and anime Naruto, It stars Junko Takeuchi, Nana Mizuki, Chie Nakamura, Showtaro Morikubo, Satoshi Hino, Kazuhiko Inoue and Noriaki Sugiyama. Set before the finale of Naruto, the film focuses on Naruto Uzumaki's ninja team as they go on a mission to stop the moon from falling, and 
          rescue Hanabi Hyuga — Hinata Hyuga's sister — from Toneri Otsutsuki, a man who wishes to marry Hinata and punish mankind for weaponising chakra.
        </p>
          <p style="font-size:30px">
            The film premiered on 6 December 2014. Kishimoto created new designs for the characters, since they are now young adults rather than teenagers as depicted in Naruto: Shippuden. Kishimoto and the writers focused on the romantic relationship between the main characters; although
            Kishimoto was uncomfortable depicting romantic scenes, he enjoyed seeing the output. The film's theme song is Sukima Switch's "Hoshi no Utsuwa".
          </p>
          <p style="font-size:30px">
            The Last had been the franchise's highest-grossing film before it was surpassed by its sequel, Boruto: Naruto the Movie (2015). The film was also a critical success, with a number of writers praising its story, for its focus on Naruto and Hinata's relationship and animation. However, its lack of an appealing antagonist was criticised.
            The film's Japanese home-media release was one of the year's best sellers.
          </p>
          <h10 style="font-size:30px">Plot</h10>
          <p11 style="font-size:30px">
            Two years since the peace established in the aftermath of the Fourth Great Ninja War, the Sixth Hokage Kakashi Hatake notices that the moon is nearing Earth and will soon collide with it. The crisis is caused by Toneri Otsutsuki, a descendant of the Sage of Six Paths' twin brother Hamura Otsutsuki, who is determined to fulfill Hamura's promise to judge humanity for their millennium-long perversion of the Sage's teachings into ninjutsu. During the Rinne Festival, Hinata Hyuga knits a red scarf similar to the one Naruto wore when they first met in order to finally confess her feelings for him with Sakura Haruno offering her assistance. Hinata becomes doubtful as Naruto receives a variety of gifts from others, including another scarf in addition to being sought after\
            by other female admirers. Toneri infiltrates the Hidden Leaf to abduct Hinata, but Naruto's intervention forces him to instead kidnap her younger sister Hanabi.          
          </p11>
          <p style="font-size:30px">
            Naruto, Hinata, Sakura, Sai and Shikamaru Nara are assigned by Kakashi to rescue Hanabi. In an abandoned village of the Otsutsuki Clan, Naruto understands the concept of romantic love from seeing Hinata's memories while being caught in an illusion and spending more time with her. The Hyuga Clan revealed to be descended from Hamura's kin who remained on Earth, Toneri had transplanted Hanabi's eyes into himself so he can acquire the Tenseigan (転生眼, lit. "Reincarnation Eye") created from his ancestors' sealed eyes while proposing to Hinata. Hinata accepts the offer to save Hanabi, breaking Naruto's heart in the process as she leaves with Toneri.
            The villagers on Earth defend themselves, intercepting the moon's meteorites and evacuating civilians while former rogue ninja Sasuke Uchiha returns to aid in protecting his home.
            <p style="font-size:30px">
              After recovering for three days, Sakura reassures Naruto that Hinata loves him and the group approaches Toneri's castle. Hamura's spirit contacted Hinata, asking for her help as the Byakugan Princess as Toneri has misinterpreted his decree. Toneri refuses to listen to Hinata, ruins the scarf and brainwashes her. Hinata sheds a tear over her regret about "betraying" Naruto. Invading Toneri's castle, Sakura and Sai secure Hanabi while Shikamaru holds off Toneri's puppets. Naruto saves Hinata and her attempt to stop Toneri for gaining the Tenseigan. But Toneri acquires it and slices the moon in half as Naruto engages him in combat and overpowers the Otsutsuki with Hinata's help, causing the moon to return to its orbit due to mixing their chakra. After Hinata takes back Hanabi's eyes, Toneri realizes the truth about Hamura's decree and decides to remain on the moon to atone for his sins. 
             After Naruto tells Hinata that the scarf he wore earlier belonged to his late mother, they declare their love for each other and return home.
             <p style="font-size:30px">
              During the final credits, Naruto and Hinata marry in front of their friends. The post-credits scene before the epilogue depicts them starting a family with their two children: Boruto and Himawari Uzumaki.
